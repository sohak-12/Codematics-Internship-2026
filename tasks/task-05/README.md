# Task 05: Keefer Law Firm Website

## Overview
For this milestone, I took on the challenge of recreating a professional legal website: **Keefer Law Firm**. The primary objective was
absolute pixel-perfection, ensuring every border-shadow, texture, and typographic detail matched the original reference design exactly.
To demonstrate my versatility as a developer, I implemented this project using two distinct methodologies:
1. **The Modern Way:** Utilizing **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first, rapid build.
2. **The Fundamental Way:** Writing **Pure HTML & CSS** from scratch to ensure a deep understanding of layout logic.

## Implementation Highlights
* **Official Legal Aesthetic:** Used serif typography (Georgia) and a sophisticated Dark Red & Gray color palette to maintain a formal,
    authoritative tone.
* **Two-Tone Typography:** Successfully implemented multi-colored headings (e.g., "PRACTICE **AREAS**") to mirror the specific branding
    of the law firm.
* **Texture-First Design:** Moved beyond solid colors by integrating provided textures for the navigation bar, call-to-action buttons, and footer.
* **Smart Asset Integration:** * Utilized specific **shadow images** (`hr_shadow`) to create depth between sections.
    * Integrated **custom bullet icons** for practice area lists.
    * Displayed professional accreditation badges (Avvo, National College) for authenticity.

## Responsive & Mobile-First
Despite the complex textures, the site is fully responsive:
* **Adaptive Navigation:** On smaller screens, the top menu neatly collapses into a mobile-friendly icon.
* **Single-Column Stacking:** The multi-column desktop layout gracefully stacks on mobile devices for optimal readability.
* **Flexible Banner:** The "Call Our Offices" header adjusts its size and position to remain clear on all screen resolutions.

## How to View the Project
Navigate to the directory and choose your preferred version:

* **Tailwind Version:** `src/Tailwind/index.html`
* **Pure CSS Version:** `src/HTML-CSS/index.html`

*Note: Please ensure the `/Images` folder remains in the root directory for the textures, shadows, and legal badges to render correctly.*

## Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** For semantic document structure.
* **Tailwind CSS:** (via CDN) for modern, utility-based styling.
* **CSS3:** For custom scratch-built styles and texture mapping.

## Lessons Learned
This task was an exercise in "attention to detail." Recreating a legal site taught me how to handle subtle design elements like background textures and shadow separators, which often make the difference between a "basic" site and a "professional" one.
